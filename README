fooling_snn
   by Marcus Soll

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tool which creates fooling images for a deep neural network (AlexNet [1])
using the Caffe framework[2].

Usage:
 - Put file 'deploy.prototxt' with network description in the working 
   directory. The first input dimension must be 1.
 - Put file 'bvlc_alexnet.caffemodel' with trained layer in working directory.
 - Only one instance of the program may run in a single working directory at
   any given time.
